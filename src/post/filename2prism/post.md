> Converts source code filenames to PrismJS language aliases.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```sh
$ npm i filename2prism --save
```

## Usage

The following reads a directory of source code files, highlights them according to their filenames, and then outputs the results to another directory:

```js
const path = require('path')
const fs = require('fs')

const filename2prism = require('filename2prism')
const prism = require('prismjs')
require('prismjs/components/')() // Loads all languages

const src = 'path/to/some/src/dir'
const out = 'path/to/some/out/dir'

fs.readdirSync(src)
  .filter(name => fs.statSync(path.join(src, name)).isFile())
  .forEach(name => {
    let alias = filename2prism(name)

    if (typeof alias === 'undefined') {
      throw new Error('No matching language found from filename!')
    }

    if (Array.isArray(alias)) {
      // Multiple matches found, picked first one for simplicity
      alias = alias[0]
    } // else one match was found

    fs.writeFileSync(
      path.join(out, name),
      prism.highlight(
        fs.readFileSync(path.join(src, name)).toString(),
        prism.languages[alias],
        alias
      )
    )
  })
```

## Method

`filename2prism(filename) -> string | Array<string> | undefined`

Returns a PrismJS language alias from a filename. A `string` is returned if there was one match, an `Array<string>` is returned if there were multiple matches, and `undefined` is returned if there was no match.

Parameters:
 * `filename` : `string` - The filename to infer a PrismJS alias from.
